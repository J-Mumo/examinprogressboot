    The individual voting rights / control / share of profits to the individual developers 
    is roughly proportional to their contribution.
    
    Additional Licensors may be added to this license if the licensors agree to it based
    on their voting rights.   In the case that a contributor is to work on the project
    and not be a licensor they need to sign a waiver that they understand they do not
    have voting rights, control or a share of profits.  This waiver remains in force
    until the current licensors agree to add the licensor to this license as a licensor.
    
    The SpotADev software has a proprietary license. Please look at or request
